# QE Docset

The scripts in this repo is designated to generated a docset for [Quantum ESPRESSO](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/) (QE), an open-source package for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale, which should work with offline API documentation browsers such as [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) and [Zeal](https://zealdocs.org/).
